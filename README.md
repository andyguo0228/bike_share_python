# Divvy Bike Share Project
This project presents an in-depth analysis of Chicago's Divvy Bike Share program, originally completed as part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate. Employing tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the analysis focuses on the program's pricing plans and categorization of users into casual riders and annual members. The study includes comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where data types are thoroughly examined and transformed, emphasizing the behavioral patterns of different user groups. Key aspects of the project involve sophisticated data manipulation, visualization, and the derivation of insights critical for improving the program's business strategies. This work showcases my proficiency in data analytics and my ability to convert complex datasets into meaningful and actionable business intelligence
